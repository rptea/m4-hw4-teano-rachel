            <h2>Dream. Perfect. Regime.</h2>
                <p>Christian Yu is the visionary behind <b>Dream Perfect Regime (DPR)</b>, a dynamic creative collective. Originally from Australia, the Korean-Australian artist moved to Korea with the ambition of starting a new movement—though he wasn't entirely sure what form it would take. His journey took an unexpected turn when he was recruited into a K-pop boy group, immersing him in the industry's rigid structure. While the experience was challenging, it provided him with invaluable connections that would later shape his career. Determined to break free from the contrainsts of the traditional music industry, Christian sought to create something entirely new. His meeting with Scott served as the turning point, blending Ian's vision with Scott's strategic planning. With the addition of Dabin as their first artist, DPR was built on the foundation of creativity, independence, and artistic innovation.</p>
